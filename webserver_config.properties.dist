## Repository and test branches information ##################

# The moodle repository where the branches are located.
repository="git://github.com/moodle/moodle.git"

# The base where both before and after branches will be updated.
# This is necessary in case there are changes in
# the generators codebase between before and after, we would not
# be able to compare results as the test plan generator or the
# generated data would change, so this setting will always be
# pointing to a minor or major release hash.
#
# You don't need to change this value
# This is Moodle 2.6dev version 2013092700.00
basecommit="d45e65ccadbf4097a970655941ac1c5cae17f26d"
# Older bases in the branch will be listed here.
# Example:
# This is Moodle 2.6dev version 2013092700.00
# basecommit="this_is_an_example_of_how_we_will_show_previous_base_commits_of_this_branch"

# The original branch.
# Usually one of Moodle's weekly released branches. You can also use a git hash here.
beforebranch="master"

# The branch to compare against.
# Usually your development branch or the same $beforebranch value if
# you are comparing different settings configurations. You can also use a git hash here.
